# Cloud Development Environment with Terraform and AWS 

This project configures a cloud-based development environment on AWS using Terraform, allowing direct access and management of an EC2 instance through VS Code. Itâ€™s part of my Cloud Resume Challenge and was created to enhance my Terraform skills, specifically in AWS resource provisioning, SSH configuration, and workspace integration for remote development.

## Project Overview

This project deploys an AWS EC2 instance within a custom VPC using Terraform. We configure VS Code to connect to the instance, providing command-line access and direct file management on the server, all from within VS Code. 

Key highlights:
- **Provisioning**: Using Terraform to automate the setup of networking resources (VPC, subnets, security groups) and the EC2 instance.
- **Configuration**: Setting up SSH access from VS Code, enabling seamless console and file explorer integration.
- **Access Management**: Using AWS IAM, key pairs, and security groups to securely manage access.

## Architecture Diagram

The architecture includes:
- A custom VPC with a public subnet.
- An Internet Gateway and Route Table for internet access.
- An EC2 instance in the public subnet with SSH access enabled.
- Security groups configured to allow secure access.

## Setup Instructions

To recreate this setup, follow these steps (detailed instructions can be found in [this YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/iRaai1IBlB0?si=3vtDKXboFfF5XgP6)):

1. **IAM User Creation**: Create an AWS IAM user with necessary access policies.
2. **Environment Setup**: Configure VS Code with the AWS Toolkit and set up credentials.
3. **Terraform Project Setup**: Create Terraform configuration files (`main.tf`, `providers.tf`) and initialize the project.
4. **Resource Deployment**: Deploy a VPC, subnets, an Internet Gateway, a security group, and an EC2 instance.
5. **Access Configuration**: Configure VS Code to SSH into the EC2 instance automatically.

## Code Walkthrough

### `main.tf`

This file defines the infrastructure resources, including:
- **Provider Configuration**: Specifies the AWS provider and region.
- **VPC and Subnet**: Sets up a custom VPC and a public subnet.
- **Internet Gateway and Route Table**: Enables internet access within the VPC.
- **Security Group**: Allows SSH access from specific IPs.
- **EC2 Instance**: Deploys the instance and configures the SSH access, enabling VS Code to connect.

### `providers.tf`

This file initializes the AWS provider and sets the shared credentials profile, which connects Terraform to your AWS account securely.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I gained experience in:
- **Terraform Syntax and Resource Management**: Writing and structuring Terraform configuration files, using modules, and managing resources in AWS.
- **AWS Networking and Security**: Creating VPCs, managing routing, configuring security groups, and handling IAM roles.
- **Troubleshooting and Debugging**: Overcoming common issues related to resource dependencies, access permissions, and configuration errors.
- **CI/CD Practices**: Integrating VS Code with AWS for a seamless cloud-based development workflow.
- **Terraform State Management**: Understanding state files, `terraform apply`, and `terraform destroy` workflows.

## Results

With the final setup, VS Code connects to the EC2 instance via SSH, allowing both console access and workspace management:
- **Terminal Access**: Use VS Code's integrated terminal to run commands directly on the instance.
- **File Management**: Open, edit, and manage files on the server as though they were local, making it ideal for remote development tasks.
